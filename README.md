# Calculator
A calculator app works like a usual one you have in your smart phone including some basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
I first followed a YouTube video to build this app but as soon as I realized, his app seems to be too simple to be practically used in real life. Therefore, in my own version of calculator app, I have added some improvement upon what I have learnt from that video. Although itâ€™s not mind-blowing upgrade as my in-time goal is just to get as close to a normal calculator, the process of making thing has already a joy to me. 

here is what I have learned from this project:
- How to use only pure JavaScript to dynamically set HTML and CSS elements.
- Regular Expression
- documenting a project
